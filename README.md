room-assistant is a simple Node.js server for tracking presence and other things on a per-room basis.
It pairs well with the [mqtt_room](https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt_room/) component of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).

**Upgrading from room-assistant 0.x?** Please review the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/Upgrade-Guide).

## What can room-assistant do for you?

Motion sensors for home automation pose an issue: they require constant motion to stay activated. This will inevitably lead to a lot of frantic hand waving in front of the sensors when you're working on something and the light goes out.
This piece of software can help you by scanning for Bluetooth tags in each room that it is placed in and estimating their distance. Just throw on a compatible beacon or smart watch and Home Assistant will always know where you are in your home.
You can even customize the light settings or thermostat preferences based on who is in the room.

Additionally to the presence tracking room-assistant also comes with a few components to make your automations even smarter. It can handle GPIO components like motion sensors to augment your Bluetooth presence tracking and even execute shell commands for complete flexibility.
A list of all the modules and their options is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/Configuration).

## Installation

### Running with NodeJS

#### Requirements

Please make sure you have [a recent version of NodeJS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions), as the one provided by Raspbian is outdated. 
For room-assistant we recommend using:

- NodeJS 8.0 or higher
- npm 5.7.1 or higher

If you want to run any Bluetooth related components you will also need some additional packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

#### Setting up

You can install room-assistant into a directory of your choice by cloning the git repository and installing the main dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant.git
cd room-assistant
npm install --production
```

Once you have your [configuration](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/Configuration) in place you can start the service manually:

```bash
npm start
```

Any additional dependencies of the services you selected will be downloaded before the software starts.

#### Running without root/sudo

This enables us to send/receive ble data without root by giving rights to the node process:

sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)

#### Making it a service

To make sure your room-assistant is always running you should setup a service for it. On newer systems this can be done easily using systemd.
Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/room-assistant.service` with your favorite editor and fill it with the following data:

```
[Unit]
Description=Room Assistant service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/room-assistant
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
User=pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the file, then enable and start the service using the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable room-assistant.service
sudo systemctl start room-assistant.service
```

You can now check the service status by running:

```bash
systemctl status room-assistant.service
```

#### Updating

To update room-assistant you simply need to pull the new version from GitHub and update the dependencies:

```bash
git pull
npm install --production
```

### Running with Docker

Currently two images are provided, a regular amd64 one and an arm32 based version. If you are running a Linux board like the Raspberry Pi you will most likely need the arm32 version. Find the available version tags on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkerix/room-assistant/).

Configuration can be done by providing your container with the needed environment variables as described in the [wiki examples](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/Configuration).

**Example amd64**

```
docker run --network=host --restart=unless-stopped -d --name room-assistant -e SERVICES=ble,console mkerix/room-assistant
``` 

**Example arm32, e.g. Raspberry Pi**

```
docker run --network=host --restart=unless-stopped -d --name room-assistant -e SERVICES=ble,console mkerix/room-assistant:latest-arm32
```

**Example docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  room-assistant:
    image: mkerix/room-assistant
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      SERVICES: 'ble,console'
      ROOM: 'docker-room'
```

### Running with Hass.io

To run on Hass.io please add [my addon repository](https://github.com/mKeRix/hassio-repo) to your installation as described.
You should then be able to select room-assistant from the add-on store and [configure it with the normal JSON based syntax](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/Configuration).

## Configuration

You can find detailed information about all available services and options in the [wiki](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/Configuration).

## Troubleshooting

If you are running into issues, please consult the [FAQ section](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/wiki/FAQ) and search through the [issues](https://github.com/mKeRix/room-assistant/issues) before creating a new one.
